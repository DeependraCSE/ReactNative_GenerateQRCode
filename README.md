This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project.

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Project Setup

First, you will need to install node dependency for React Native.

To install dependency run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm install

```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

Use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npx react-native run-android

```

### iOS

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npx react-native run-ios


```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
